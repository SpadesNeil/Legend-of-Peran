Refusal of the Return - the Hero has mastered the strange world he was thrust into. He probably has earned a permanent place here, if he wants it. He may even want to stay, but usually there are forces at work that propel him home

Crossing the Return Threshold - Sometimes a fight against the forces of the Muggle world, which the Hero wins thanks to help from his Muggle allies. This is where the Post-Climax Confrontation happens, as the remaining antagonistic forces have followed the Hero beyond the threshold and attacked him at a time when the plot should be wrapping up. In the absence of any action, it may be a Boring Return Journey instead, a chance for the Hero to reflect on what he's gained and experienced through his journey.
