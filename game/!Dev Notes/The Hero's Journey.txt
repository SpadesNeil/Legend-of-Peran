Beginning in the Hero's World
- At home in Dawnville.

The Call to Adventure – Hero receives calling to the unknown
- Ace and others suggest going to Bornemouth to find better paying work.

Refusal of the Call – Obligations or fear prevent hero from starting the journey
- "I need to watch after my sister." Or don't.

Supernatural Aid – Magical helper appears or becomes known
- Ace gives Blackjack the magic compass.

The Pathfinder is an artifact that Ace acquired in his old adventures. It's allegedly from Avro, Lord of the Skies, and God of Self-Determination. It does not point north, but rather, points to guide you toward whatever your heart desires the most, whether you know it yet or not. The compass can also fill your dreams with visions of what could be. The problem is, the needle is broken. Acacius's ex-wife broke the compass when she left him. When asked if Ace ever used the compass, Ace would say yes. If asked if he ever found what he was looking for, he will reply, "I did." So what was it? Ace solemnly says, "It pointed to her." Ace goes on to explain that he has no use for the compass anymore. He doesn't want to seek his wife out, knowing it will only bring him heartbreak. He suggests that if Blackjack wants to restore the compass for his own use, Blackjack should find the Temple of Avro. If asked where to find the temple, Ace admits he doesn't actually know. He found the compass by chance during his adventures, and never thought to ask. He suggests exploring Valdis and talking to important people to learn more. "Although, I'll save you some time. Don't bother with Dawnville," he says. "Only people who've experienced true freedom would know where to find it. Nothing against the people of Dawnville, but they're prisoners to their own fears, too scared to see the world. They'd rather live in quiet security rather than freedom." Ace suggests Blackjack travel to settlements across Valdis.


Crossing the First Threshold – Hero leaves its known world and ventures into the unknown

The Road of Trials – Hero must pass a series of test to begin the transformation
- 

Meeting with the Goddess/Love – Hero experiences unconditional love
- 

Temptation – Hero face temptation that will distract from ultimate quest
- 

Atonement with the Hero’s Father – Hero must confront the person that holds ultimate power in their life
- 

Night Sea Voyage - sneak into the Big Bad's lair to get something or someone
- 

Apotheosis
- 

Peace and Fulfillment Before the Hero’s Return – Hero moves to a state of divine knowledge (usually through some form of death)
- 

The Ultimate Boon – Achievement of goal
- 

Refusal of the Return – Having found bliss and enlightenment in the other world, hero may be reluctant to return
- 

Magic Flight – Sometimes the hero has to escape with the boon
- 

Rescue from Without – Sometimes the hero needs a rescuer
- 

Refusal of the Return - the Hero has mastered the strange world he was thrust into. He probably has earned a permanent place here, if he wants it. He may even want to stay, but usually there are forces at work that propel him home
- 

Crossing the Return Threshold - Sometimes a fight against the forces of the Muggle world, which the Hero wins thanks to help from his Muggle allies. This is where the Post-Climax Confrontation happens, as the remaining antagonistic forces have followed the Hero beyond the threshold and attacked him at a time when the plot should be wrapping up. In the absence of any action, it may be a Boring Return Journey instead, a chance for the Hero to reflect on what he's gained and experienced through his journey.

Master of Two Worlds – Hero achieves balance between the material and spiritual (inner and outer world)
